    <h4>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that 
        makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy 
        it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the 
        outside, and so juicy inside.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>New York Steak</li>
        <li>Top Sirloin Steak</li>
        <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
